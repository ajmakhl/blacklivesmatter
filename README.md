# Black Lives Matter

I made this small component that allows your viewers to visit a page dedicated to helping the cause picked randomly by a list. The goal is to have a central point where people can get information faster.

> If you have any concerns with the list please let me know and/or if you would like to add to the list. Submit the form https://forms.gle/9zidftAqgSo2Avb56

```js
var sites = [
  "https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_blm_homepage_2019",
  "https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/",
  "https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_FE78X-qdY",
  "https://www.joincampaignzero.org/",
  "https://www.knowyourrightscamp.com/"
]
```

I hope this is a step towards something good. You can use this by adding the following iframe in your website.

```html
<iframe
  frameborder="0"
  width="500px"
  height="300px"
  src="https://ajmakhl.github.io/blacklivesmatter/"
  title="Black Lives Matter"
></iframe>
```
